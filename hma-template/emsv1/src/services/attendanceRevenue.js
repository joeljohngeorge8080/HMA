/**
 * attendanceRevenue.js — Attendance Deduction Pool (TPC only).
 *
 * When a TPC (Third Party Contract) staff member is Absent, takes a
 * Half-Day, or accumulates excess Late units, the salary not paid out is
 * retained by the company and tracked here as a separate revenue pool.
 * Only TPC-category employees contribute — Permanent/FTC deductions are
 * surfaced as "savings" elsewhere but are NOT pooled as revenue.
 *
 * Deduction formula matches Attendance → Deductions exactly (via the shared
 * attendanceCalc.computeAttendanceDeduction):
 *   per-day rate  = monthly salary ÷ (present + absent days)
 *   absent        = absent days × per-day rate
 *   half-day      = half-day count × 4 × hourly rate
 *   late          = excess units (beyond 7 free) × per-day rate ÷ 32
 * Paid leave (CL/SL/OD/COFF) is never deducted.
